### About the Experiment 

A non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) is an abstraction of a memory-less machine with transitions that need not be unique. A NFA either accepts or rejects a string by running through a sequence of states that are non-deterministically chosen upon reading the sequence of symbols in the given string. A language of a NFA is the set of all strings that are accepted by it.
